# fCPU Codes

Welcome to my collection of custom Factorio fCPU codes! The fCPU mod, created by [extermeon](https://mods.factorio.com/user/extermeon), allows you to write low-level machine code directly in your Factorio game. This repository serves as a personal backup and showcase for various projects I've developed using the fCPU.

## What is fCPU?
The fCPU (Factorio Customizable Processing Unit) is an advanced mod that introduces programmable microcontroller capabilities into Factorio, enabling complex logic through machine code. It features a vector coprocessor with support for many useful instructions, providing unprecedented control over your automated systems.

## Project Overview
This repository contains multiple projects I've developed using the fCPU mod. Each project is stored in its own subfolder and includes:
- The `.fcpu` file containing the machine code.
- A screenshot demonstrating how the code is implemented within Factorio.

## Getting Started
1. **Install the [fCPU](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fcpu) Mod**: Ensure you have the latest version of the fCPU mod installed in your Factorio installation directory.
2. **Load Factorio**: Launch the game and create a new world or load an existing one.
3. **Place fCPU Machines**: Place an fCPU in your game to start using them.
4. **Import Code Files**: Copy the code from the `.fcpu` file and paste it into your fCPU.

## Conclusion
Feel free to explore these projects as a starting point for your own Factorio automation adventures. While this repository is primarily for personal backup, I hope it can inspire others to create and share their own fCPU codes!

Enjoy coding with fCPU and automating your Factorio world!
